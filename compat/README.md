# Compatibility layer

These files provide the exact same interface as libqasm used to, for
compatibility purposes. Their implementation is modified to be a header-only
wrapper around the new library, so bugfixes and (compatible) additions made
in the new library translate into the old API as much as possible.

Given the choice, however, please use the new API. The old API leaks memory
by design, and its exception mechanism is very confused (most of the time,
the return codes can only ever be success, because exceptions prevent them
from being set to failure), to name a few of the many things wrong with
it.

The original readme file follows.

# libQASM: Library to parse cQASM v1.0 files

## Dependencies
* Flex (> 2.6)
* Bison (> 3.0)
* cmake (> 2.8)
* gcc and g++ capable of C++11 standard
* MinGW (For Windows builds)
* doctest (As a git submodule)

### If python module is required
* Python3 (Tested on Python v3.6)
* Swig
    * Linux: 3.0.12
    * Windows: 4.0.0

## Organization
* The accompanying paper and BNF specification for the cQASM v1.0 are located in the **./doc** directory
* The library itself is located in the **./src** directory

## Installation

### As a standalone C++ library
As the library uses doctest as part of the testing procedure. In order to install (assuming the present working directory is at **./src**):
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir cbuild
cd cbuild
cmake ../library
make or make -j \<Number of processors\>
make test or make test -j \<Number of processors\>
```

### As a standalone C++ library (Windows)
Same as the above, except we'll use the MinGW toolchain. You should first get [mingw-w64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) and install it.
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir cbuild
cd cbuild
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..\library\
mingw32-make.exe
mingw32-make.exe test
```

This will output `_libQasm.pyd`, `liblexgram.dll` and a static library `liblexgramstatic.a`

### As a python3 module
Install from the project root directory:
```
pip install .
python -m unittest discover -s src/tests -v
```

### Cleaning up the src directory (not Windows)
In order to clean up the entire source directory when a user installs using the setup.py python script:
```
make clean
```
